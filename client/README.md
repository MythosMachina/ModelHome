# MyLora Lazy Client 

This utility mirrors LoRA files from a running MyLora instance. It creates
0-byte placeholder files that are replaced with the real `.safetensors` on
first access.

## Installation

Install the client dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.toml`:

```toml
server_url = "http://127.0.0.1:9090"  # URL of your MyLora server
data_dir = "./lora_mount"              # Directory for placeholders and downloads
username = ""                          # Optional: user name for /login
password = ""                          # Optional: password for /login
```

If `username` and `password` are provided, the client performs a login against
`/login` before requesting any files. Leaving them blank keeps guest mode which
only allows access to the public showcase.

## Usage

```
python client.py
```

A watcher thread listens for file open events in `data_dir`. When a placeholder
is opened it downloads the real file from `server_url`. After 60 seconds of
inactivity the file is removed and a placeholder is recreated.
